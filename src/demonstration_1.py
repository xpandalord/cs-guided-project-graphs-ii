"""
An `image` is represented by a 2-D array of integers, each integer representing
the pixel value of the image (from 0 to 65535).
​
Given a coordinate `(sr, sc)` representing the starting pixel (row and column)
of the flood fill, and a pixel value `newColor`, "flood fill" the image.
​
To perform a "flood fill", consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels
connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the
starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also
with the same color as the starting pixel), and so on. Replace the color of all
of the aforementioned pixels with the newColor.
​
At the end, return the modified image.
​
Example 1:
​
```plaintext
Input:
image = [
    [1,1,1],
    [1,1,0],
    [1,0,1]
]
sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2
Output: [
    [2,2,2],
    [2,2,0],
    [2,0,1]
]
Explanation:
From the center of the image (with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1)), all pixels
connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel are colored with
the new color.
Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally
connected to the starting pixel.
```
​
Notes:
​
- The length of `image` and `image[0]` will be in the range `[1, 50]`.
- The given starting pixel will satisfy `0 <= sr < image.length` and
`0 <= sc < image[0].length`.
- The value of each color in `image[i][j]` and `newColor` will be an integer in
`[0, 65535]`.
